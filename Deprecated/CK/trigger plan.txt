## initial trigger, 

province counter is at 0
player brings 0 cyber core to 0

add 1 to province counter

etc

## set countyloc on cybercore to detect player 12's units

##initialize trigger

if mobilization (flag) is exactly 2
if province counter (data disc) is at 0
if player brings cybernetics core to 0
if spawn units is at most 0 (0-5)
if hp is at most 49000

add 1000 hp
add 1000 deaths

	Deaths("Current Player", "Flag", Exactly, 2);
	Deaths("Current Player", "Data Disc", Exactly, 0);
	Bring("Current Player", "Protoss Cybernetics Core", "Duchy of Lancaster", Exactly, 1);
	Bring("Player 12", "Men", "CountyLocUniversal", Exactly, 0);
	Deaths("Current Player", "Protoss Unused Type 2", at most, 0);
	Memory(19027, At Most, 12544255);


	Set Deaths("Current Player", "Int:1585", Add, 256000);
	Set Deaths("Current Player", "Protoss Unused Type 2", Add, 1000);
	Preserve Trigger();

## make trigger to skip holding if player 12 men are detected

## set stage 2

	Deaths("Current Player", "Flag", Exactly, 2);
	Deaths("Current Player", "Data Disc", Exactly, 0);
	Bring("Current Player", "Protoss Cybernetics Core", "Duchy of Lancaster", Exactly, 1);
	Deaths("Current Player", "Protoss Unused Type 2", at most, 0);
	Memory(19027, At Least, 12544000);

	Move Location("Current Player", "Protoss Cybernetics Core", "Duchy of Lancaster", "County Loc Universal");
	Set Deaths("Current Player", "Protoss Unused Type 1", Add, 1);
	Preserve Trigger();

if province counter (data disc) is at 0
if player brings cybernetics core to 0
if mobilization (flag) is exactly 2
if spawn units is at 0 (0-5)
if hp is at least 49000

move location to cyber core at 0
set spawn units set to 1 (spawn cavalry)









spawn triggers:

if spawn units set to 1
if deaths are 4000

spawn cavalry
add 4000 deaths to buffer (nexus)
set deaths to 0
set spawn units to 2

base unit is 45240
trigger adds 4000 hp and 4000 to death counter, in 1000 increments, until "at least 49000"
depending on how many death counters, spawn units. (inverse -- 0 deaths is max level)

then add 400 in 100 increments
spawn

then add 40
spawn

then add 4
spawn
