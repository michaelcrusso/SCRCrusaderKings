High Priority:

[] Fix duchy sieges, with more emphasis on PvE. Consider adding a Stage 2 trigger after a successful siege that will detect which player won the siege, and then add the corresponding number of kills to the Duchy to keep track of its original owner.
[] Re-enable Doodad State for occupied duchies.
[] Script sieges for Towns and Castles
[] Add penalty to demobilize units in combat/near enemies. 50% chance of not returning manpower.
[] Add Warscore counter + ticking warscore counters. Display warscore at bottom. Also use unit deaths as flag for attacker/defender for different wars (War 1, War 2, War 3, 0 = attacker, 1 = defender, 3 = participant).
[] Add verbose text to siege/demobilize triggers.

Medium Priority:

[X] Add penalty to unit spawns while in debt
[] Use "low morale" units for spawns while in debt.
[] Place "at war with" unit over CPU/Player diplo flags to mark war status. Use the actual zerg units, but make them flying units that can't move and can stack infinitely, with blue fire aesthetic.
[] Find some way to cap manpower
[] Add penalty/unit removal for debt
[] Add attrition trigger (25% chance every 6 seconds?)
[] Space out income triggers. Accelerate arithmetic.
[] Include buttons on Duchies for "Demand in wargoal" for when a duchy is occupied, disabled when it's not.
[] Remove buttons from Starport. Add "assault" button. Change unit AI behaviors.

Low Priority

[] Add an "Information" button on duchies and baronies
[] Rig together some basic white peace/conquest to end war
[] Add Major siege event triggers (successful sally, disease in the camp, water shortage)
[] Add button to building to set spawn rally point/use switch to indicate whether spawns occur at rally or at building location.
[] Fix music triggers?
[] Triggers for disloyal vassals (Blue fire unit over Duchy, gives -50% troops, subtracts 1 from income).
[] Vassal interaction buttons on duchy (raise relations, send gift, imprison, etc).
[] Make diplo unit location centering more elegant
[] Diplo flag could use decimal places to store country information; e.g. If at war with 1234, at war with players 1, 2, 3, 4.
[] Use set invincibility for upgrade triggers. Make SCV and other units invisible.
[] Fix reenable levy spawn.
[] Increase density in Italy. Split Apulia and Calabria in half.
