initialization trigger sets total manpower AND effective manpower
regen functions also in peacetime

full mobilization zeroes out effective manpower
demobilization removes units one by one and returns them to effective manpower pool

england: 6 counties, 2 castles, 6 duchies
	2	3	5

france: 11 counties, 1 castle, 8 duchies
	2		3	5

scotland: 5 counties, 1 castle, 5 duchies
	2		3	5

if player owns at least 1 town lvl 2

etc

//

if player owns at least 1 town lvl 1
if player owns at most 0 town lvl 1-2-3-4-

then

skip straight to next holding type

--------------------------------------

return units that have fought to player's reserve pools?

if at war and re-raising levies, have random chance of injuring units?
